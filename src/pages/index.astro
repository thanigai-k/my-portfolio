  <p>
    I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer at
    <a href="https://full.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      Full Creative
    </a>, working on the Earth Design System. I focus on design systems,
    accessibility, performance, and developer experience—building scalable,
    accessible components and a flexible StyleAPI so teams can ship consistent
    UIs without fighting the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    I work with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind; run frontend workshops
    and pair programming; and care a lot about component architecture, WAI-ARIA,
    and reducing cognitive load for design-system consumers. I also tinker with
    AI integration (e.g. sentiment analysis, quick-action palettes) and keep an
    architect’s mindset even for small components.
