I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer at [Full Creative](https://full.io), working on the Earth Design System. I focus on design systems, accessibility, performance, and developer experience—building scalable, accessible components and a flexible StyleAPI so teams can ship consistent UIs without fighting the system.

I work with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind; run frontend workshops and pair programming; and care a lot about component architecture, WAI-ARIA, and reducing cognitive load for design-system consumers. I also tinker with AI integration (e.g. sentiment analysis, quick-action palettes) and keep an architect’s mindset even for small components.

This site hosts my thoughts, projects, and experiences. You can dig into those or find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/thanix-k), [X](https://x.com/itsmethanigai), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thanigai-breathes-tech/).
